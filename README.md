## What it looks like

```
 ⎇ main   ⚙ Building (14s)…   📣 Postman — test your APIs in seconds →   $(coin) ₹0.04 this session
```

The moment you run `npm run build`, `cargo build`, `pytest`, `docker pull` etc., a sponsored line appears on the right side of your status bar. When the task finishes, it flashes `✓ Earned ₹0.08 this build` for 4 seconds, then disappears.

---

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

### Step 1 — Get your invite code

Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run:

```
DevCut: Open Website / Get Invite Code
```

Or go directly to → **https://waitwage-production.up.railway.app/site/**

Fill in your name and email. You'll receive an email with your personal invite code — looks like `DCUT-XXXX-XXXX-XX`.

### Step 2 — Activate in VS Code

Open the command palette and run:

```
DevCut: Activate with Invite Code
```

Paste your `DCUT-XXXX-XXXX-XX` code. Done. You'll see:

> *"DevCut activated! You will start earning on your next build."*

### Step 3 — Run a build

Run any tracked command (`npm run build`, `yarn install`, `pytest`, etc.) and watch the status bar.
